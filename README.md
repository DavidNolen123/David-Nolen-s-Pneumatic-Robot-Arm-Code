This code is written for Arduino UNO. My code implements PID algorithms for controlling solenoid valves of the pneumatic robot arm.

Code by David B. Nolen. I attend Trinity School of Durham and Chapel Hill.

**I am also the lead coder for my schools robotics team. All of these coding repositories are listed under a different shared robotics team git acount: tsdch-robotics
